## Hey there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> 🌳 🧗‍♂️ ⛰️ 💻 🇮🇳

I'm a **Fronend Engineer** and I'm passionate about learning new **technologies**.

Always looking for a challenging new task with the opportunity to work with the latest technologies on challenging and diverse projects. 

I started my career as a web designer. I use to create User interfaces and branding. I use to convert those designs using HTML and JS. Slowly I realize that I was enjoying the coding part a lot and after getting in touch with React and Vue I completely shifted from being a designer to a Frontend developer. So mind works in both ways - designer and coder. 

I'm Indian and I'm currently living in **Udaipur, India** 🇮🇳 and actively participate in local and international community activities and events.

I love to code :computer:, travel ⛰️ and learn new things.

## My stack is as follows ⚡

* HTML, 
* CSS, 
* JavaScript, 
* TypeScript, 
* React, 
* Next.js, 
* React-Query,
* Vue
